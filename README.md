# üß† German-to-Arabic Translation Quality Evaluation with BERT & BLEURT

This NLP project focuses on evaluating the quality of translated sentences from **German to Arabic** using advanced deep learning techniques including **BERT** and **BLEURT**.

---

## üéØ Objective

To automatically assess or classify the quality of translations using semantic embeddings and scoring models. The project combines linguistic preprocessing with transformer-based evaluation models to judge how close a translation is to its source meaning.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- File: `e-f-dataset.csv`
- Contains sentences (likely source‚Äìtranslation pairs)
- Features may include original German sentence, Arabic translation, and human ratings (if available)

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Read dataset and analyze basic stats
   - Print sample rows to understand structure

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization using `nltk`
   - Stopword removal
   - Encoding labels (if classification used)

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Use **BERT embeddings** to encode sentence meaning
   - Apply **BLEURT** for semantic similarity scoring

4. **Model Training**
   - A `Sequential` neural network model (Keras) trained on sentence embeddings
   - Classifies or scores translation quality

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy (for classification) or BLEURT scores (for similarity)
   - Optional: Use `transformers` for fine-tuned BERT model (`BertForSequenceClassification`)
